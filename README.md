# Mp3 Karaoke

## Gladia Audio Transcription API

The main goal was to set the base of a karaoke aplicacion using Gladia Api.
It works, but you need the mp3 file to upload and charge the "lyrics".
The other problem is the Api doesn't really is for song transcription. Some songs stop giving lyrics for seconds (i presume is for the melody being
to loud or somethign like that). But is almost perfect when it works!
